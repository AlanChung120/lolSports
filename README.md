Finished and uploaded April 24th, 2023. Used Xcode (Swift, Storyboard interface, and UIKit). This is a sports feed application for Leauge of Legends esports. <br />
It has three tab: standings tab, matches tab, settings tab <br />
Standings Tab: It displays the standings of the major leagues the user follows (LCK, LPL, LEC, LCS, MSI, and Worlds) <br />
Matches Tab: It displays the results and upcoming matches day by day for the major leagues the user follows <br />
Settings Tab: You can decide which major leagues (LCK, LPL, LEC, LCS, MSI, Worlds) to follow and whether to hide score (spoilers) or not <br />
This application uses the free version of the PandaScoreAPI. So API usage is limited <br />
